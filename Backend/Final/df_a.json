So my initial question was do these sound as good as my Airpods? I started with the song I always listen to when I get a new pair of headphones, Hotel California by Eagles, and these headphones well they sounded too sharp almost pain full like those cheap 100 Rs earphones.So, I saw some reviews and there was a split some saying they are pretty good and others saying they are not good for music and so on. I ended up replacing my first pair of JBL. The point being if they sound like crap start by replacing them because no headphone should sound that sharp especially not with a branded pair they probably have a QC issue.  My second pair of these JBL's arrived the next, they sounded like the graph that is shown on the box pulled up high-end, mids, and bass basically increasing the overall volume of the headphone sounds bad right well not really.It's not for music I mean you can listen to it it's not bad but it's not very good either, it depends on what you listen to for example if you listen to Bollywood trash (no offense I listen to them from time to time) then these headphones are not it but if you listen to older songs from classic bands (pink Floyd, guns and roses, etc) or for that matter classic Indian Sangeet those extra high-end notes really make these headphone sing. Movies are amazing, remember the extra mids and bass from the graphs well they do an amazing job of recreating the voices and the atmosphere the extra highs can be a problem if the actor has a higher-pitched voice and gets irritating so pick your poison.Gaming, these are gaming headphones after all. I play games on my Xbox, I bought them for my Xbox and I have not a single bad thing to say about these even my first defective pair blew my head. Witcher 3 (Yes, I still play that game) the atmosphere the headphones create is truly amazing there were times I turned back to see if there was actually someone, it blows my AirPods away, you could hear the tree trunk crack leaves fly the wind it's truly something to experience. Next is Forza and my opinion stays the same, same with AC odyssey as well as PUPG. The mic is also very good too video calls or phone calls should not be an issue at all I mean if you are planning to buy rebranded Chinese crap from the likes of cosmic bite or Red dragon or gear then stop and buy this instead. But if you are planning to buy the more expensive Hyper x cloud series then buy that only this is not for you.Finally, let's talk about fit and finish as it will determine the isolation and comfort of any headphones. For me these headphones fit perfectly, they clamp down with just enough pressure so as to not hurt my head but are strong enough to prevent them from falling off. The fit almost reminds me of Bose QC 25 headphones. This means the isolation is pretty awesome they are no active noise canceling of course but is more inline with passive noise isolating earphone so basically all the earphone on the market. The drives are placed at some distance from your ear this does two things. One, your ears don't rest on the driver like in most of these cheap Chinese crap second it helps with spatial audio. The finish, on the other hand, well its cheap plastic and there is no two ways about it you touch the headphone you will know what I am talking about, It won't break but its no bose or apple in this regard, you get what you pay for the cable is braided and tangle-free though. The cushion is pretty good, it not the softest memory foam or the thickest but again it gets the job done it's covered with fake leather and is nonreplaceable so when they wear out you need to buy a brand new pair of headphones.Conclusion, buy them if you are on a budget I don't think there is a better pair at this price that has the audio quality this has in games. If you have no budget and want a headphone that does everything then my Airpods pro is the winners but I would recommend the hyper x cloud series for gaming if you have the budget for it at 7K.  Or if you want something to go along with your Xbox and don't want to spend too much like me then I would say buy these you will be happy.","Sound quality is amazing, both in game and while consuming entertainment media. Bass is slightly lower, however the audio is clear and well defined. Extremely comfortable to wear, even for individuals using glasses. Over the ear fit perfect encompasses the entire ear. Sound adjustment is easy, button is present for hardware mic enable and disable, works as expected. Mic is detachable. Mic clarity is fantastic, but has tendency to sometimes pick up background noise If the noise if very prevalent (non issue in most areas, unless outdoors). Only negative would be the thin and non detachable aux cable. A slightly thicker briaded version would have more durability, but all in all a great purchase.","If you are looking mainly for calls or meeting then you can go for it. It is good enough.Outside AC rooms, your ears can sweat if used for long time.For movies\/music, this is not that good when compared to other JBL products in same price range like Infinity Tranz which has good bass.","I have just purchased and not used for long time to determine and comment. In the three weeks, I have found the following:1. Long wire with 3.5mm connector suitable for phones \/ laptops \/ pads. Using a conversion connector, it can be used on the radio set. Need to check with the manual what is the size of connector required.2. Noise dampened increasing audio level heard.3. Volume control works independently. If the mobile is set to high and volume on headphones reduced, the reduced audio level is heard and not the one set on the mobile.","Really impressed by the sound quality. I've been using it only for a couple of days now. There is no jarring in your ears. The sound is really smooth. I used it for music, movies, games & no complaints so far. Looks like a real monies worth product.The only negative is the fact that after using it for a while, your ears do hurt a little because of the pressing but that is not brand exclusive. Happens with all headphones.","The braided wire seems forever twisted. It's quite annoying while working or playing.","Good for teleconferencing, which is what I brought it for.Ok for watching movies.Not good for music as bass is poor.Pain in ears after using for 1 hr plus.","I have used this for office calls and sometimes for watching movies. Have used for more than 1.5yrs and it has started wearing out the earphone leather and the inner sponge is also visible now. However the sound and others is still working. I think it would be good if it's just cloth not leather. So that it doesn't sweat much after using more than 2hrs+ in warm conditions","Pedi na Sexta (19\/03\/2021), chegou hoje, na Ter\u00e7a (23\/03\/2021), muito r\u00e1pido.O produto \u00e9 de qualidade, valoriza bastante os graves, nem tem o que dizer, um t\u00edpico de um JBL.O microfone vem destacado em um pl\u00e1stico junto com o manual.O fone veda muito o exterior, com ele no ouvido mesmo que desligado, quase n\u00e3o se ouve nada.Pessoal que talvez n\u00e3o saiba... Os Pcs e Notebooks n\u00e3o possuem entrada P3 (um pino que comanda o microfone e o alto falante ao mesmo tempo), essa entrada P3 geralmente s\u00f3 est\u00e1 presente nos celulares (por isso voc\u00ea pode falar e ouvir em uma chamada de telefone pelo fone). Exemplo disso, comprei uma placa m\u00e3e ASUS TUF GAMING B550M PLUS, mesmo sendo avan\u00e7ada (v\u00e1rias entradas no 'Jack de \u00c1udio'), n\u00e3o possui entrada P2 para esses fones.Ou seja, os Headset (Fones iguais a esse), se for pra usar no pc, voc\u00ea ter\u00e1 3 op\u00e7\u00f5es:1 - Usar s\u00f3 para ouvir (entrada verde)2 - Usar s\u00f3 para falar no microfone (entrada vermelha)3 - Comprar um adaptador de entrada P3 para convers\u00e3o em P2 (para usar as duas fun\u00e7\u00f5es no pc, ele dividir\u00e1 a entrada em 2 pinos pra voc\u00ea)Ent\u00e3o... N\u00e3o achem que n\u00e3o funciona as duas fun\u00e7\u00f5es.Detalhe: O cabo \u00e9 curto, se tiver o gabinete pr\u00f3ximo ter\u00e1 fio de sobra, mas se estiver longe demais talvez use ele com o fio mais esticado.","Sou professor e comprei o headset para utilizar em reuni\u00f5es e aulas online. O headset \u00e9 bem confort\u00e1vel, com som equilibrado e boa capta\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1udio. O \u00fanico por\u00e9m (para mim) \u00e9 o fato de que o controle de volume n\u00e3o fica no fio mas no fone esquerdo, e isso me atrapalha um pouco. Outra coisa para observar \u00e9 que o cabo \u00e9 relativamente curto. Se voc\u00ea for utilizar pr\u00f3ximo ao notebook (que \u00e9 o meu caso), fica bem tranquilo. Mas \u00e9 importante verificar a dist\u00e2ncia que se precisa entre o headset e o dispositivo. Mas recomendo demais o produto.","Microfone n\u00e3o funciona. O \u00e1udio \u00e9 captado pelo alto falante do lado direito e n\u00e3o pelo microfone.","These headphones for the price are brilliant, I bought them to use for streaming and gaming. I bought these after buying two other crappy headphones which I returned.These are brilliant great sound quality, nice fit, really have a quality feel even from the packaging.It doesn't come with any bribes like give us a 5* review and we will give you \u00a320 crap.(Honestly this what make Amazon so hard to find decent products.)But for the price these are great.If you're a professional musician or studio producer I wouldn't recommend but for average gaming and discord these work brilliantly.","Don't buy. The mic does not work, tried it on discord and google meat and loads of other websites. Nothing. Tried plugging into into both my monitor and pc, nothing. I bought an adapter so I could connect it to my phone and use it that way, finally it worked but the audio quality was horrific, it kept cutting out and you could barely hear it. Waste of money, will be returning."],"Store":"a"},{"Srno":16,"Product_Name":"EKSA E900Pro Gaming Wired Over Ear Headphones with Virtual 7.1 Surround Sound Noise Cancelling with Mic & Led Compatible with PC PS4 PS5 Xbox One","Description":"NA","Price":2599.0,"Url":"https:\/\/www.amazon.in\/sspa\/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo2NDI2MTA2MTQyMDc2ODQ3OjE2NjQ1MjM2MDU6c3BfYXRmOjIwMDIzMDcwMzgyMjA2OjowOjo&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&url=%2FEKSA-E900-Cancelling-Headphones-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB07MV44RHD%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2_sspa%3Fkeywords%3DGaming%2BHeadphone%26qid%3D1664523605%26qu%3DeyJxc2MiOiI1LjkzIiwicXNhIjoiNS43OCIsInFzcCI6IjQuOTgifQ%253D%253D%26sr%3D8-2-spons%26psc%3D1","Image_URL":"https:\/\/images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51RHBpeTFvL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg","Ratings":4.0,"Reviews":["The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0First lets start with whats inside the box1. The headphone itself ( without cables attached )2. An EKSA branded leather feel bag which contains all these  1. 3.5 mm to 3.5mm cable ( male to male , one end has a proprietary lock mechanism which makes it stay in the headphones and not fall off )  2. 3.5 mm splitter ( to input and output ports , included in my pictures )  3. USB-type c to USB-type a cable ( yes the new models come with type c cables , and it does not have any lock mechanism so any type c cable should work )  4. Documentation ( including user manual and an easy user manual )I'm sorry for not including the photo of the box , i threw it away . But dont throw it away as soon as you open it . you  should refer to it for registering warranty and downloading the softwareSo now lets talk about the headphones ,1. Build & design( For your information I bought these headphones for 2700 rupees )These headphones are really well built for this price , although majority of the material used it plastic it does not feel cheap , it feels good ( not very premium either but not cheap too ) . The piece holding the drivers in place is made of metal ( the one that you slide for adjusting ) and its really solid . The wires connecting the drivers are coiled and are placed outside ( this makes them look like a premium pair of headphones ).The design is very good and I know this is a very subjective one , but still the headphone doesn't scream gamery , its a fully black design with subtle red accents , EKSA logo on the headband ( very subtle , cant notice easily ) and finally the 'E' logo on the sides light up when connected via the USB cable. These are open back styled headphones ( refer pictures for more information )2. Provided accessoriesThey provide you with all the accessories you actually need and nothing you don't .The 3.5 mm cables are all gold plated and feels of good quality .The given 3.5 mm AUX cable has a lock mechanism on one side which makes sure it does not come off accidentally while using the headphones.Giving a 3.5mm audio splitter in the box is a nice touch but I would strongly recommend using these headphones with USB as it has better sound quality , virtual surround is available only on USB and also the 'E' logo lights up lol.The given type-c cable is also of good quality and almost 2 meters in length ( approx )3. SoftwareEKSA has their own software on their website and you can download based on what headphones you received , mostly its the new model but if by any chance you get the old model then download accordingly ( the only difference between them is micro USB and USB type c )I have attached pictures of all the features of the software .For speakers it has sound control , 10 band equalizer , virtual surround sound , sample rate adjustment , environment effects (literally useless) and two other things which I have no idea about.For microphone it has volume control ( mic boost in a nutshell ) , sample rate , some cool effects ( voice changer basically )  and finally noise reduction.Surround soundI used surround sound for a while and it just makes the audio sound from a distance , the surround effect is good but i would not suggest it for competitive games which render audio in stereo , this just messes those up . so i would recommend turning this off while playing those type of games . but for single player games and games which have surround sound ( not tried yet ) you will have a better experience. I often use this for music .MicrophoneHere we come to the good part , this is by far one of the best microphones i have used in a while . i have tried so many headphones ( including expensive gaming ones ) and this just blew them away . The vocals are so crisp and the compression is low , so others can hear your voice perfectly and even tiny details are noticeable , the only thing is this does not pick up the bass in your voice very well other than that its just excellent. you can adjust the mic to any direction you want ( its very flexible ) and the mic also comes with a filter , i would recommend leaving that on.Sound qualityThis is the most important part , so I'll try to be explain as much as possibleFirst of all i'm no audiophile , but i listen to music very often and i am a basshead . These headphones were so perfect for me as these are slightly bass heavy and produce clean bass ( very slight muddiness ) .  Other sound stages were very good , the mids and highs were produced correctly . This also does not leak sound when its on your head . first i though they were leaking sound so i asked someone if sound was leaking and they told me it was quiet and they could not hear anything.ComfortI come from using light headphones so these felt heavy at first ( and yes they are a bit heavy  ) but if headphones have correct cushion softness and weight balance , the weight won't be felt on us. This is the story with these headphones too , the weight balance is on point and i did not feel any discomfort after long gaming hours except some heat inside the headphones , this is to be expected as the ear cushions are covered in a leather feel material ( the good thing is you can get replacement cushions on their website ) but other than that its soft as it should be not too soft nor too hard . The headband has a firmer cushion , I wish it has softer cushions there but still can't complain .Headphone featuresThe headphone has a volume knob and a physical mute switch behind the left ear cup , they do their jobs perfectly but i wish they put it somewhere else . i am really nit picking at this point . you will get used to the placement in a couple of days .OverallThese are a very good pair of headphones in this price range , especially the mic quality is top notch ( even beats many expensive headphones ) , very subtle design , the software lets you control almost everything , the build quality is very good for the price and you can also get all replacements on their website . I have attached many pictures and a video to help you decide . Rate this helpful if you found it so , hope this helps . We also run a channel on telegram which helps people with tech , search paidfreedroid official on telegram and i can help you with any queries :)Have a good day","Pros:1. Durable. I have been using these for almost 1.5 years now. The earpads have slightly begun to wear off, but it has no effect on the comfort or audio quality.2. Comfortable. I am an excessive user and on some days have even wore these for over 12 hours continuously. Can't complain much!3. Audio quality is pretty good. Be it gaming, music, phone\/video calls, etc.4. Build quality is quite strong. I am somewhat a rough user who ends up breaking most of my(and others') stuff. These have managed to hold their ground.5. Detachable mic. I don't use it much so I like that I can get it out of my face.Cons:1. Microphone isn't great. It's the only thing holding this headphone back from me giving 5 stars man. The mic doesn't register my voice clearly at a comfortable distance, and if I bring it too close people hear me breathing like a bull.2. Not ideal for travelling. This is a gaming headphone so I guess that goes without saying. You CAN carry them, it just might not be ideal considering the wires are really long and the headphones don't fit well to outdoor aesthetics.","The product works really well and the sound from the headphones are just amazing. The bass is okay, nothing too exciting. This is perfect for gamers as the sounds are very precise and the ear cussions are very comfortable to wear for a long time.The worst part was the packaging, the cussions were stuffed by the other things in the box and was in an irregular shape. Rest everything about the headphones is absolutely fine.","A great if not the best headphone in the price range. I've used it for 6 days, no issues yet. I was looking for the best gaming headphones under Rs3000 for gaming, listening to music, watching movies, etc. that would last me for years. After watching and reading a lot of reviews, I've narrowed down to Eksa E900 pro and I don't regret it. A friend of mine has the Coolermaster Ch321 which is in the same price range, I tested the headset myself and the sound quality is better in the Eksa E900 pro in my opinion, in games like Valorant, Pubg, etc. footsteps are clear with directions and on top of that bass is quite good for music too, but the mic quality might be a bit better on the Coolermaster. However, Eksa is versatile and can be used on different platforms including phones(3.5mm jack), consoles, etc. which to me is important. I have a small head and the Eksa fits great, it is quite comfy and I can wear them for hours, also, even though i normally sweat a lot, my ears don't sweat much while using these headphones for long periods. Build quality is also good. Overall I recommend this headphone to anyone looking for the best headphone in the Rs3000 price range. My only complaint is the packaging from Amazon, the headphone was packed in the paper bag kind of packaging without any bubble wraps which could easily damage the product while shipping and handling. Due to that I deducted the 1 star.","Erst einmal zu den Kopfh\u00f6rern selbst: Die sind Top, machen nen guten Sound und lassen sich echt lange tragen.Mit denen kann man tats\u00e4chlich nichts verkehrt machen. Eine Lautst\u00e4rkeregelung am Headset beim USB-Betrieb w\u00e4re noch cool gewesen, aber ansonsten bin ich sehr zufrieden.Anfangs dachte ich allerdings, dass die Surround-Funktion nicht richtig funktionieren w\u00fcrde. Das lag jedoch an meinen Windows 10-Einstellungen. Der Treiber \"Windows Sonic f\u00fcr Kopfh\u00f6rer\" muss zuerst manuell aktiviert werden, das passiert nicht automatisch.\u00dcber Systemsteuerung --> Hardware und Sound --> Sound  das Headset ausw\u00e4hlen, die Eigenschaften aufrufen und unter \"Raumklang\" im Dropdown-Men\u00fc \"Windows Sonic f\u00fcr Kopfh\u00f6rer\" ausw\u00e4hlen und - ganz wichtig -  einen Haken bei \"7.1 Virtual Surround\" setzen.Testet eure Einstellung gerne mit ein paar Dolby Test Youtube-Videos. Dabei achtet am Besten aber auch darauf, dass Youtube nur Surround-Sound ausgibt, wenn die Videoqualit\u00e4t auf 1024p steht.Wenn das alles eingestellt ist steht dem Spiel- und Filmvergn\u00fcgen mit diesem Headset nichts mehr im Wege!","Amazing sound. I can't say much bad about this. The sound is great, I use these playing my xbox one and the jack being connected to my controller. When wearing these the sound of footsteps when playing things like cod, and its very easy to determine where your enemy is .The cushion on the ears are nice and soft but also a nice easy to wipe material and compared to my old material ones that disintegrated, these are much better and will last.The head band is easily adjusted and stays in place well.Very happy with this item","Honestly from reviews I expected this headset to be half decent but sadly this isn't the case. Playing alone on the xbox one is fine the sound quality isn't that great but usable, however playing with a friend in a party caused alot of problems sound wise for them. Everything I was doing in game they could hear such as shooting weapons as well as hearing their own voice. I tired for quite some time to fix the problems but to no success. Also for anyone that hasn't realised you can only use the 7.1 Surround sound system on pc not on console which is a shame. Will most definitely be replacing this headset so I can play with my friends without them wanting to rip their ears off. Wouldn't recommend","If your looking for a good budget gaming headset then you\u2019ve found one, these are great for the price. First of all they look good, come in a pouch, useful to store your spare cables etc in, you get a 3.5mm Jack to use with phone or console etc and usb which you need for the 7.1 surround on the pc (which is what I\u2019m using it for). Please note to get 7.1 surround to work you need to download the driver which there are 2 versions just make sure you download the correct version. Once the usb is plugged in the red lights active which don\u2019t distract, the cups of the headset are comfortable after long period of use and the headset is very light. Only slight con is headset is just fit my head (might just be me).Sound quality is great with controls on left cup, with mute for Mic ( can also take mic off if not using ). 7.1 surround worked well for me in FPS games, baring in mind it\u2019s a budget headset, and working perfectly in windows 10. I haven\u2019t used mic as of yet but tested in windows and seemed to be ok. With all the sponsored reviews out there I was bit worried till I received these, but these will serve you well till you choose to upgrade to a premium headset.2 years warranty from manufacturer to finish it all off, you can\u2019t go wrong, buy it!","I bought this primarily for gaming.  It is a good headset.  It is fairly comfortable on the head.  I do tend to find that the material on the earpads make my head sweat after long use, but noise cancellation is excellent.The surround sound whilst gaming is good.  360 degree sounds really helps on FPS games like CoD and Battlefield.

But you won't need full volume because it is already good. It is good for movies and music. It has 50mm drivers. People are saying it is not loud, but it is.Mic Test 9\/10- Mic is good, voice is crystal clear with little noise picking like keyboard, someone speaking. You have to adjust sensitivity and mic loudness in control panel of windows. See some tutorial and then you can. You can use some chrome\/edge extension to disable auto gain on sites.Comfort 8\/10 - Very good comfort, there will be sweat, but it is negligible, you won't feel it. sometimes it might pain if you don't set it correctly, if you set it correctly, then very good.Cable 10\/10 - Good cable, it is braided, you will need splitter to use it in mobiles and laptop. Must buy gold plated splitter for clearness of mic and sound. Cable length is good too.LED - RGB changing every 2 second, very premium lookController in Cable 10\/10 - Mic on\/off switch is good. Sound controller wheel is also good.Weight 8\/10 - You can see, this headphone's weight is 380G, you won't feel it that much. good.Build Quality 10\/10 - Build quality is good, very flexible, but it will last a long. You can go buy this if you want good build quality.Left and Right 10\/10 - I have tested it with 8D audio and both channels work very fine. You can buy if you want good left and right audio channels.Overall Rating - 8\/10Should you buy it?

The audio is very good for games or music, the mic is good as well but when flipping up to but it makes a loud noise both for you and whoever you are speaking to. The wire is also very thin and not braided however it never gave any problems and is quite long.If you are buying for pc it comes with audio splitter and I recommend using it. If you are buying for laptop I recommend buying a USB adapter as it makes the audio much clearer. All of this is ok and I'm sure anyone can live with it but the biggest complaint is the build quality, I've had these headphones for only 8 months and the connection between earcup nad headband already broke. But this is to be expected with a budget headset.","Sound Quality: Well it's crisp and clear but keep in mind that it's a stereo headset and not a 5.1 headset. Which means if you're playing mobile games like pubgm, it's pretty good but not if you want to play competitively in like some pc game. Also there's no bass in this headset, I kind of expected it to have some moderate bass because it has 50mm drivers but there's little to no bass. Even my 700rs Sony's have the same amount of bass and thyre not the xtrabass variants either, don't buy this headset for listening to music or you'll be disappointed. I first thought that my unit was defective or something so I got a replacement but still the same case.Mic is great though.Gaming: Fine but not great for competitive gaming. It's a stereo headset and if you can save some more Money, try to get a 5.1headset instead. But better than needed for Mobile gaming and campaign based pc games.Value for money: I have no clue why it's asking price is 6400 something on their site but i got the lightning deal for 3500. Sound quality is nice but little to no bass takes the immersion away. Mic is great, packaging was nice, the volume slider at back is great but kinda hard to reach. (slider was slightly broken but my replacement unit was perfectly fine).Its comfortable at first but starts to pain during longer sessions, especially if you have a small head or wear glasses. This is coming from a Logitech fan (i use Logitech keyboard and mouse and they're nearly perfect), I really didn't expect this from a 6 grand product. If you can save a bit more try to go for Razer kraken X \/Corsair hs50\/ Hyperx cloud stinger instead AND IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE RGB MAN, no dedicated software either. Couldn't even return it so had to replace my unit, all coming from a fellow gamer like you. I really hope buyers read my review before spending their hard earned cash and I would recommend you to hold on to your current headset if you can. It's obviously better that 3x cheap Chinese headsets (in some aspects) but sound tbh is about the same quality, either go for a more expensive better model or use your existing ones.","I bought these headphone for 3.7k recently. I have been using it for almost a week now and these are some of the pros and cons i have found:Pros:1. Sound quality is really good for this price (don't expect bass in gaming headphones), supports 3-D audio really well for games like PUBG and CS GO.2. Light weight - I don't feel the heaviness in this headset. They are feather-light.3. Comfortable - yes absolutely comfortable, wore them straight for 6 hours and didn't feel uncomfortable for a second.4. Flip to mute works perfectly.5. Noise cancellation is pretty good, it cancels most of the noise coming from the surroundings, wouldn't say the best but they are good for this price.6. You get the audio splitter in the box where it splits the single end of the headset in to two ends if you have 2 ports. So no need to buy an extra splitter.7. Mic works absolutely well and its flexible enough to move freely.Cons:1. Build is not the best, most of it is plastic. Again you are provided with light weighted headphones so don't expect the best build. Earcups make squeaky noise when you rotate or turn them (might be a fault in my piece or may be coz its quite new).2. Cannot remove the mic from the headset. So when I bought this headset, logitech g233 which was similarly priced to g331(~3.8k) and g233 had this facility to remove it.3. Volume control is placed on the earcups so its always a pain to lift your hand till the ears and control the volume. There are no controls present on the wire.4. Headphones wire is not of premium quality, they are quite thin.","I used to have a omen headset 800! It was miles ahead of this headset...the positional audio is weak...very little base,....not comfortable... I regret buying this\ud83e\udd26","The ear cups started flaking and mold started forming on the ear pads after about 9 months of usage. not worth it for just 1 year of service.","I have shifted from JBL Quantum to Logitech and I noticed the serious lack of sound quality in comparison. Also software support for enhancing the quality was lacking compared to JBL. I use it mostly for online meetings and Gaming for that purpose it provide great experience. While streaming movies and music it lacks a lot.

After thoroughly testing series of budget headphones, I can safely say that this is the best budget headphones out there in the world.When you are searching for a gaming headphone, it very important to get your priority right. Most people just think that a good surround sound such as virtual 7.1 makes a headphone a gaming headphone. That is not so. A stereo headphone too can be classified as a gaming headphone and many reviewers and gamers themselves prefer to use a stereo headphone for the audio quality and versatility that it provides.These headphones are excellent gaming headphones in the sense that they provide excellent \"gaming music\" quality. That sweet sound of clashing of the swords and that of wasted cartilages falling of your guns or even the subtle sound of turning the door knob or picking the lock all that is amazingly delivered to your ears and the sound should be so crisp & clear that you should find yourself immersed in those sounds rather than the game itself. My brother had purchased a Kraken X from Amazon, which broke after 1 1\/2 month while one day he was just removing off his head. The Kraken had an amazing sound quality that came with poor build. Lenovo Legion H300 provides the same audio quality (or better?) without compromising on the build.The thing about Lenovo Legion H300 is that the makers of this headphone seem to have put as much effort in the design and build as they have put in its sound calibration. You will find yourself wondering what in the world are all these premium headphone brands doing when it was possible to make a headphone reasonable in cost and superior in quality and under 2000 bucks. By the way, this headphone has potential to satisfy an audiophile, too. Just get your sound drivers right \ud83d\ude0aI personally use APO Equalizer + HeSuVi (Headphone Surround Vitualization software) to take the audio experience to the next level. Just buy these headphones and set yourself up with HeSuVi surround sound and thank me later. Now for the numbers...Build Quality: 5\/5- Enough said already.Audio Quality: 5\/5- Enough said already.Microphone Noise Cancellation: 4\/5- Actually, higher range headphones have exceptional noise cancellation which you usually won't find in a budget headphone.Noise isolation: 5\/5- Pretty good. You cannot hear someone standing beside speaking to you while something is playing in your headphones unless that person actually shouts. But it does not provide that super-isolation where the roof crashes besides you and you yet don't know anything has happened around you.Comfort: 100\/5- Yes. It is not a hyperbole. Use it and you will feel it.Overall: 5\/5X-Factor: Design. The rotating cups which cover you ear and headband attached to those cups. The overall combination is not just super-innovative and comfortable but attractive too!Things to watch out for: Remember that experiment you might have done as a kid where your connected two coconut shells with a metal string and spoken with the person at the other end. And your friend or your sibling at the other end might have scratched the coconut just to irritate you. Okay, your friend might have not scratched the coconut. But I would recommend you to not scratch your headphone like my friend did with the coconut. Not because it will make scratches on headphone but because it will sound as if the scratching is coming from inside the headphone. Yes, the headphone material propagates the slightest, the faintest of sound delivering it to you ears. Even, something such as brushing off of that dust settled on your headphones. The material used is very sensitive to the touch and carries the sound to your ears.Apart from this, few international reviewers have reported about cover material coming off the headband (the padding at the top) coming off exposing the soft sponge inside the headphones. Now, I am not sure how much of this is true. I will have to wait and watch.TL; DR You can blindly purchase these headphones for a under Rs. 2500\/- budget unless you are looking for a true superior quality virtual surround which cannot be delivered by a stereo headphone. (Actually, it can be\u2026 With the help of Windows Sonic and stuff but not at the quality of a true 7.1 surround sound headphones.) Also, surround sound quality and sound quality are two different things. Don't mix them up and curse the product later. Check what you need before you buy and don\u2019t blame the product later.","Bought it in 2021, The mic stopped working.Went to Service centres in Jabalpur, but they say do not give service for Headphones.Can anyone help, where to get service \/ warranty claim.","Here's my review of H300 after a week!Comfort is at just another level.Although it feels a bit heavy at the start but you will get used to it or maybe I felt it heavy because I was using just a Sony Headset with 30mm driver before this.The ear cups seems to be durable and doesn't have those typical wrinkled raxine like texture which over the time turns into Powders and pieces.Braided cable is pretty tough and long, the plastic quality is more likely to be above decent level.It comes with a splitter that means you can also use this headset on other devices as phones and tablets.Coming to the Sound Quality.Its totally Balanced, period.Don't expect a very high bass level from this headset, (like boat and redgears) although it supports a 5.1 channel and you cannot use the microphone while you're on the  5.1 channel. (I am using the realtek audio console to tune the audio)The earcups block the outter noise to a decent level.The microphone!Its good! Seriously its good!Pair it with discords voice sensitivity like feature and you're just clear and loud in games.I bought this at \u20b92000 from amazon and the price has been to a lot higher since then.I would definitely suggest this headset only if you're getting it between somewhere between 2000-2500 rupees. If its above that just don't buy this and look for something else in the bigger brands like razer.This was a totally a honest review for this product.:)Thankyou!","I'm using this headphone for more than 5 months for WFH calls. This review is based on this. Not used for gaming or movies.Voice clarity and mic reception are excellent. Physical mute\/unmute button, long braided cable, flexible & adjustible mic, comfortable ear cussions, comfortable over ear wearing etc. are positives. But I want to focus on one negative which outrun all these positives.After using it moderately for work for around 1 month, realized that right ear getting slightly more sound than left. This caused mild pain for right ear even when not wearing it.But now (after 5 months) it is interchanged. Left ear is getting noticeably more sound than right. It is not a connected device issue or my perception issue. Confirmed by changing connected devices and switching earphone positions left - right. I'm using it by changing the balance between L and R in Windows using its native volume mixer.Bonus note if you still want to buy: I bought it for Rs.1999 by waiting and checking for deals everyday.","It\u2019s a pretty decent thing for the price.The ear cushions are pretty good, and made of faux leather. Did not notice any sweating or anything even after using for 5 to 6 hours.The mic quality is pretty nice, and has some basic noise cancellation like some wind noise and noisy fans etc.it had passive noise cancellation, but the clamping force is just too less. It sits on your head, and if it weren\u2019t the case the cancellation would be great.It comes with neodymium drivers which are 50mm. Due to this the high pitched sounds are pretty sharp and good, but lacks bass.Gaming is a very nice experience on this. It catches even the slightest of sounds, so good for pubg and Csgo players","In 15 days of usage only sound is coming fr9m right side headphone as some peice is lose inside or broken and making noise.

Most of the motherboard now a days comes with 7.1 audio so no need to buy any dedicated sound card.It is a niche product. That means it is not for everyone. It is only great if you have 7.1 audio channels in your setup otherwise it is worthless. It is not versatile; I mean not a jack of all trades. You will get blown away (for a 5-6k headphone) if your content supports proper 7.1 audio like Blu-ray Movies, Games etc. The problem is most YouTube reviews research less and post reviews with a poor background check.Now I am aware that for many users with the latest Windows 10, the Realtek driver is not working properly and you can find this solution in Google. I have shared the configuration you need to use to make the audio perfect. Here is my,Pros:1. Extremely comfortable and relatively lightweight with sturdiness. Feels like a well-built product. The large earcups can cover the entire ear and the cushion is great. Does not heart at all for 4-5hrs of continuous use.2. The lights on the speaker cover can be covered with the help of supplied magnetic cover if you want to.3. Cable quality is very good and feels durable.4. Sounds amazing with combined 2x5 drivers including dedicated subwoofer keeping in mind you know how to configure it with your 7.1 audio. It easily blows away any headphone ~8 to 9k price tag.5. RGB lighting but for me, I don't like it at all. May be person-dependent though. But I don't bother it.Cons:3. The controller marking\/text is a bit too small and hard to read in low light conditions.4. Average microphone quality.Now the most important part, CONFIGURATION:1. As mentioned in the supplied quick start guide, plug all 5 jacks one by one in your motherboard's rear 7.1 audio port and wait each time for the jack detection popup. If the popup is not appearing then wait, remove the jack, plug it again and you will get the popup. Once all individual jacks are detected by the motherboard properly then you can be sure that it should work properly otherwise not. I mean the subwoofer jack should be in the subwoofer port of the motherboard and while plugged for the first time should detect as a subwoofer like that.2. Go to your Realtek sound manager and select 7.1 setup if not selected automatically. You can also do it same from the windows 'Sounds' option. I have posted a detailed step-by-step image guide separately for Realtek Control Panel (Pic 1 & 2) and Windows Sounds Control Panel (Pic 3 & 4). You can follow any from these two based on your PC condition.3. Click on individual speaker ikons in the Sounds control panel to make sure that each 7+1 speaker\/subwoofer is making sound. If not, you must plug it in properly again.4. If you want you can add room correction in order to increase the radius of the zone. But it is not necessary and if you screw it up it may sound poor.5. Most IMPORTANT: Now in the control unit of the headphone, select individual channels and set the volume as half of the entire range i.e. 50% volume (8 dots), increase the level of the subwoofer to 70-75% (~11 dots) and microphone volume to 100% for the initial test. DON'T CRANK UP EVERY INDIVIDUAL CHANNEL TO MAX. IT IS FOR MAINTAINING THE BALANCE OF THE AUDIO.6. Don\u2019t activate Windows Spatial Audio at all costs. It is not designed for 7.1 analog setup.Now test it with any movies which have dedicated 7.1 channel audio or configure Game audio as Home Theatre or Home Cinema Mode and DON\u2019T USE HEADPHONE MODE AND TEST THE DIRECTIONAL SOUND. It is just awesome, and I bet you that you have to reduce the subwoofer volume to 60-65% (no of dots on the control panel).I have played many games and I bet you can detect enemy footsteps coming from behind way better than any stereo headphone at this price point 5-8K INR.But I must say, People, are spreading misleading info because they don\u2019t know how to do it. Since it is a niche product, it is not designed for everyone and can\u2019t be fully utilized in a laptop kind of setup. But for all newer PCs, I Guarantee, you don\u2019t need any dedicated DAC\/sound card to feel the pure awesomeness of this headphone in any 7.1 media content and of course Games.","Hi guys , this is a true 7.1 feel if u configure a little bitFirst of all the headphone's quality is really good and reduce the outer noise very well. And looks wise I personally like it but somehow some people might feel like old fashioned, but quality it's is crystal audio if u configured wrongly u might get over sharpen audio and no bass. So don't collapse to configure it ...It's really very simpleFirst u need a 8 or 7.1 channel support motherboardAm using x399 arous pro motherboardWhich supports this and don't fear nowadays most of the motherboard were supported- First just plug the correct cables into correct jack-before connecting enable Jack detection- plug it one by one its better to configure- green jack ( out )-pink ( mic )- orange (center sub )- black ( rear )-grey ( side speaker do not select inline)( connect this in blue port or if ur mb as Grey then connect in grey )-Now under ur Realtek audio console click on settings then select speedster inline Jack'sAfter that toggle bass enhancementThen if ir driver support Amp option then select level 1 or 2 that's enoughToggke front and rear speaker opt and toggle the surround speakersAfter that check the audio , if u got audio without bass \/ subDon't worry !!! Just toggle the room correction setting and let it be default valuesU may get bass effect and clear soundAfter check that buy untoggle room correctionContrler tuning : )) for songs and movie-Center 10 - 12-front and rear 10 points-side speaker 8 to 10-sub always full-main depends on youFor mic-mic 12 points and in Realtek console select noise and echo cancelation and increase mic volume in sound settings* note select highest available quality on both speaker and mic.Now for precise gamingDon't enable game mode in onbard audio support software and don't use level 3 AmpJust use these levelsSide 12 pointsFront and rear 13 pointsSub 12 to 15 pointsCenter 12 pointsMaim volume it's depends on uMost of the gaming support only stereo audio so don't worry for that in case u faced audio cracking in game means then disable the Amp function and reduce side speaker and Center to 8pointsNow these setting will help u get the real quality of the headset and a true 7.1 feelYes u can try some 7.1 virtual support softwaresAnd am using sound blaster connect which supported by my motherboard in that I toggle neutral profile and customize that preset with the below valuesBass 8 to 15 points increaseImmersion 15 to 25Crystallize 20 to 30Reverb offSurround sense 10Don't push hard levels in software  becoz this is not a setero headset thisnis a true 7.1 hardware with dedicated speakers so if u wrong configured or over push u might get creepy audio qualitySo this the best settings which is really awesome use and feel the audio quality \ud83d\udc4cRemember u should check the audio in every steps becoz the hearings aid of everyone will differ...U may take almost an hour to configure but it's worth spending time on it becoz the output really excellent","This needs a 7.1 channel sound card. Do not buy this if your sound card\/PC does not have 4 jacks - Front L&R, Side Surround, Rear Surround, and Center\/Sub-woofer. If you are going to plug it to the single jack of your pc\/laptop, you are going to be disappointed. It will sound terrible with stereo input.Got it for \u20b94606 after coupon on Amazon. It is available in similar price range in other Indian Retail and Online stores.  Price on the box is \u20b919299. Year of import is 2020. This model is released in 2017. There is no manufacturing detail in the box. Not sure whether they are dumping old stock in India. At this price in Amazon, I'm not complaining. I have not tested the headphones with a 7.1Ch sound card. Took a leap of faith after seeing a lot of reviews. Waiting for the arrival of Creative Sound Blaster X4 to test this out.Pros-Each side has 5 different speakers.Ear cups are soft and comfortableThe transparent look is really cool.I don't think there is better product\/competitor at this price (\u20b94600~\u20b95500)Good Built quality.All cables are braided.Cons-The cable length between the controller and the headphones could have been a bit longer.Released in 2017. As far as Razer is concerned it is a Legacy Product.The latest ( as on 30-Jun-2021) Synapse i.e. Razer Synapse 3 does not support this headset. It shows as legacy device . This is supported by Synapse 2. It is a pain to find the download links in Razer website. The Synapse 2 won't open without a Razer Login. I did not find any use with the Synapse software. It only provides RGB control, no audio control. It is required only if you want to synchronize the RGB with other systems like Philips Hue. So on software side it is huge bummer.","Update: September 2020... it stopped working.  Downgrade to 0 (zero) stars.  I am not a gamer.  I do have a home cinema system. I do have neighbours and our walls are paper thin.  I need to use headphones.  Most surround sound headphones - virtual or multi-speaker assume that the sound source will be coming from a computer via USB. No good for me as I want to use my top class SONY bluray player.  I have been using an HDMI to 5.1 converter to take the audio signal from my player to a set of analogue 5.1 headphones .  Those headphones finally gave up the ghost and I have replaced with Tiamat.Pleased with the quality - both surround and two channel stereo.  The headphones are loud enough.  There is sufficient \"surround\" effect and enough bass for MCU movies and etc. - not as good as having having speakers in the corners of the room and a giant sub-woofer but good enough for me.  Comfort - again good enough for a couple of hours.One thing to note - while the audio signals are analogue these headphones need a USB connection - and not just for 5V power - they don't turn on unless there is an active USB host at the other end of the connection - so I have then powered from the USB port on a Raspberry Pi Zero.  I have not tried downloading a \"light show\" config - perhaps once that is done the headphones may run independent of USB status.","I love my tiamat they give great positional sound clarity unlike other standard 2.0 headphones and just better clarity then fake 7.0 surround headsets varies listening modes from surround to stereo for when you wont to listen to music it has outputs aswell so you can run a full 7.1 surround speaker setup along it uses standard Jack'sSetup is not instant to get the best out of them took a little configuration but once done  works wonders and you shouldent have to do it again so only a one time mess around best advice right click sound choose sound a right click speakers and you configure and make sure to set it to 7.1 and keep surround speakers selected otherwise you will get tinny playback I would advise a decent sound card to get the most out of these but will work with most motherboards on board sound along you got anuff jack inputs for 7.1","First of all, you probably need a good soundcard in order to use the headset at its full potential. My integrated soundcard on my ASUS Z270E motherboard couldn't handle that ( maybe the item was even broken, don't know ) and the sound was awful. ( like using samsung first gen white headphones awful )Second of all, the box was opened ( even though it said 'Brand New' when I ordered them. Not only that the box was opened, the headset was dusty. I probably got a refurbished or a second hand model.The heaset is uncomfortable, as a gamer, I cannot see myself using them for more than an hour. Your ears heat up a lot and you become very sweaty and then your head starts to hurt.Do they look cool? Yes.Should I take them? If you got enough money for a good soundcard, sure. But, I am sure that someone who has an external soundcard knows at least a bit about music and sound quality and probably will not even look at this headset.Do I recommend them? Big NOPE.","Nothing wrong with the headset itself it is high quality but I had trouble with setting them up other than that though it seems like a solid premium headset. My problems came with how it was delivered, the box came without any protective packaging which is fine for me but the box had obviously been previously opened and there were things missing in the box such as instructions and a few other bits and pieces. I think it's ok to sell a previously opened box with a few non crucial parts missing but they should apply a discount for these units rather than forcing the customer pay full price even though they are not getting the full product.","These have replaced my trusty tiamat v1 which I used to destruction. Very happy with these. Base just as strong with big improvements on mid and top range. Much better 7.1 sound in general as well. Quality of headband and ear cups vastly improved. Super comfortable and look amazing. Remember, these need a good, properly setup 7.1 sound card to work at their best. You do not have to spend a fortune on the card.

Also The Cushions are Soft enough and will not hurt your ears. They have passive noise cancellation, not high enough but it is medium and is enough and good.SOUND QUALITY:- It has amazing Sound Quality, I have ordered this headphones for Multimedia and movies.

Although playing games with it will not disappoint you.LIGHTING:- The RGB lights keeps changing by itself but they are amazing and will give a good experience.Talking about the CABLE QUALITY, It has braided Cable and also 2M long which is amazing and long enough.MIC QUALITY:- Mic quality I tested for calling and other person on call didn't feel like I am talking on headphone mic. They felt normal call. SO, MIC QUALITY IS ALSO AMAZING. Also it has A SWITCH for Mic ON\/OFF and Volume Control which is good.You cannot wear it over your neck, either put it over your head or away from it when you don't want to listen. They cannot be put over neck cause of BIG EARCUPS.ALL OVER REVIEW ~> Just Don't Think So much about it. They are amazing and affordable. The earcups look small in the Photos but they are Big enough and will fit perfectly for any ears. I got them in sale at 699rs.Don't buy directly, just keep it in your cart and wait for sale. You will definitely get price drop. If you get them at around 800rs, then also it is good.At this price you get braided 2M cable also with rgb and with mic and good sound quality.

The sound was artificial and lacked sub-bass.  The 3D Spatial Audio was excellent.  Comfort was mediocre.  You can get better performing headsets for cheaper - like: Corsair HS65 and EPOS H3 or H6PRO.","Sounds great. Needs more kick for me at that price point. The built feels a little too cheap.","I'm currently using the Sony In Zone H9 Wireless Headset with my PlayStation 5 via USB dongle (2.4 Ghz) and paired up to my Android phone via (Bluetooth).I own two pairs of Pulse 3D wireless headsets (Black & White) both are still working in perfect condition to compare this written comparison review.I bought the H9's to see if my gaming experience would be better compared to the Pulse 3D headset.Here's the pros and cons for the H9's comparing it to the Pulse 3D wireless headset.Pros:\u2022 H9's are very comfortable. H9's don't squeeze your head as much as the Pulse 3D's. Very little difference between the two but slightly noticable comfort.\u2022 H9's feels lighter on my head. Both are pretty light weight headsets. Most likely this is from the bigger ear cups on the H9's.\u2022 Both are Glasses friendly headsets.\u2022 Both use USB-C to charge the headsets.\u2022 Both have easy volume controls on the left ear cup. H9's has a volume wheel for adjusting the overall sound which is more user friendly compared to the up and down separate volume buttons on the Pulse 3D headset.\u2022 Both are able to adjust the game volume and voice chat volume independently. (This is a huge pro for when playing online with friends.) H9's button's are on the right ear cup. Pulse 3D's are on the left.\u2022 Noise Cancelation on the H9's is the true seller for me. It's really good. By far the best feature to have on a gaming headset. Turning the Noise Cancelation On is as easy as pressing a single button on your left ear cup to adjust the level of noise around you. When I turn on the noise cancelation to max I can't even hear my window air-conditioner any more. Which was a distraction from my gaming experience.\u2022 Microphone quality sounds allot better as what my PSN friends say.\u2022 H9's are easier to rest around your neck because the ear cups fold in towards your chest. Pulse 3D's ear cups don't fold or move at all.\u2022 H9's are able to pair a Bluetooth device while gaming on the PlayStation 5. For example I can listen to music or answer phone calls from my Smartphone all while I can still hear the game and chat audio from the PlayStation 5. Tip: Best way if you're needing to focus on your phone call press and hold the mute button on your DualSense Controller to kill the voice chat and game chat audio from the PS5.\u2022 The Sound quality from the H9 headset has better Highs and Better Lows. I ran several tests with this headset both bass sound tests and vocal sound tests. Overall the sound quality of these internal speaker's in the H9's are a improvement compared to the Pulse 3D. Both headsets have really good sound for gaming.Cons:\u2022 The Price between the two is a $200 difference. Pulse 3D is $99 and the H9's are $299.\u2022 Can't mute the microphone with the DualSense Controller. (The Pulse 3D Wireless Headset also can't mute the microphone from the DualSense Controller unless you use the 3.5 mm headphone jack to the DualSense Controller. This is a minor complaint but logically it makes sense to use the most quickest way to mute yourself for thing's like coughing or sneezing. The DualSense Controller mute button is the quickest button that's near your hands while gaming. This is a major oversight for the PS5's firmware\/hardware. Pro Tip: to mute yourself on the H9's you just flip up the boom microphone on the left ear cup until you hear a click or see the microphone is muted on the TV. With the Pulse 3D Wireless Headset you have to press the Mute button on the left ear cup.\u2022 If you're standing or sitting down and you bend over 45\u00b0 and look straight downward to the floor the H9's slowly start to slide off your head. Pulse squeeze's your head slightly more so the headset doesn't slide off your head as fast. Nothing to be major concerned about because you typically look forward while play games.\u2022 H9's don't have a 3.5 mm headphone jack. Pulse 3D headset does.\u2022 H9's don't currently have a EQ option to adjust on the PlayStation 5 compared to the Pulse 3D.Overall I'm impressed with the H9's. My only major complaint is the price and the lack of EQ settings on the PlayStation 5. Both issues could be resolved overtime. So if you're looking for a gaming headset and want good quality sound and the ability to cut out sounds around you while you're playing a video game I'd strongly recommend the H9's.If you're not wanting noise cancelation and are on a budget I'd recommend the Pulse 3D headset.","It's basically all a trick... These are $150 headphones Sony xb910n's with a low quality boom mic. Now let me tell you why they absolutely aren't xm4's or xm5's or even xm3's which is what they want you to think.This review goes in the following order...1- intro (up above sorry, it was important to say that first)2- Summary of everything written below3- Spatial or 3D audio quality & accuracy & general audio quality4- Noise Cancelling5- Conclusion[Section 2 Summary]Only 19db of noise cancelling puts them on par with $120-50 Sony xb910n's with the same sound profile as well.  Sadly those won't connect to a PS5 because...?  The Pulse 3d headphones from Sony don't have noise cancelling but do have slightly better audio quality which also means better 3d audio even if it's not nearly as good as Atmos headphone simulated 3d audio.  The Pulse headphones also block only 9db less without noise cancelling, technically enough that outside sound won't interrupt you at even half volume.  It's mic is also much better as the audio from this mic is quite poor quality especially if the room has noise like an air-conditioner, fan, or others talking.[Section 3- Spatial audio and general audio quality & how it works]I'm an audiophile so I buy lots of headphones and gaming headsets so of course I bought a pair of these and was excited for their arrival only to end up returning them because they actually sounded worse than the Sony pulse 3d headphones which already had average frequency range accuracy due to no EQ and surprisingly poor 3d or spatial audio considering it was a huge talking point for Sony also about time since their competition & PC gaming has had it for 8+ years.  Why and how did Sony drop the ball here? Let's talk about it...I had my ears measured by Sony themselves at a demo event before the pulse headphones had come out.  There was a rep setting up a display at a local audio store so I took advantage of the opportunity.  Based on measurements and some audio tests I was capable of hearing simulated 3d audio from a stereo source and I perfectly matched the PS5 default profile (hooray) and while I by far prefer traditional surround sound especially when there are also height channels for that true all around you effect there are times when headphones are required to enjoy a game or movie.  Times like late at night or early mornings or if my wife is working from home, it's also better for friends in an online game if they don't hear your game audio at 90s cell phone quality on top of their own audio... So I will use headphones in those situations and if possible I'd like them to have good 3d audio and good frequency range.So If I had to put a number to the algorithm Sony is using for spatial audio vs the industry standard which is Dolby Atmos over Stereo headphones I would say it's about 30% less accurate if you don't consider height.  So just a circle around you BUT if you consider above or below I'd say 40% less accurate.So if I put you at the center of a bubble and you could float there or I just sat you down and I had software that could trigger a sound from anywhere around you then asked you to point every time you heard various sounds or asked you to track the path of a sound as you heard it by pointing and following you would be off roughly 30-40% using Sony's algorithm.  With Atmos you would be off by about 10%.  Now it's possible Sony will improve their algorithm but it's been nearly 3 years and I don't think there have been any changes.  It also doesn't help that games need to support pulse 3d audio for any effect other than stereo and so far not many games actually do.  On the flip side with Atmos there is no support required from the content.  The algorithm is excellent at taking a stereo source and adjusting the level of each sound to trick the brain into hearing things that aren't really there.  It's definitely something I hope they work on more as I love PlayStation exclusives developed by Sony studios.Compared to devices (both single and multi driver) using formats like Atmos, DTS:X and a couple other 3d solutions with the most shocking being Windows Sonic on any cup style headphones $40 and beyond they are all more accurate at nailing the position of a sound.  That is pretty odd.The simple answer for all this are the frequencies Sony focuses on which are low frequencies, they lean into bass a bit too heavy handedly and that hurts higher frequency response when you are talking about headphones with 1 driver.  The more in depth reasons are below..For simulated 3d audio you need to nail high frequency accuracy and be good with mid range frequencies because it's significantly easier for the human ear to tell what direction something like foot steps or an average a car is coming from than it is to quickly locate something with lots of low frequency sound (aka bass) and bass has been Sony's focus for years speakers & headphones and they do it well but they do it at the expense of accuracy for mids and highs.  Its also due to how these sounds vibrate the bones in your head ever so slightly and bass tends to override everything else.This is an issue for 3d aud\u00edo from stereo headphones because often times sound cues draw attention to something or you might need to be able to hear footsteps in a game like call of duty or cars in a racing game so you know without looking where they are located with a high degree of accuracy.People using other types of 3d audio (in cross play titles or users with surround sound) will have an advantage over someone using Sony's format every time but MOST important is the fact that audio coming from the wrong place breaks immersion at worst or enhances it greatly at best.  It's your eyes vs ears, when things match up or come close enough you end up more immersed in the world the sights and sounds create instead of feeling detached or even distracted.You would be better served shutting pulse 3d off and letting the game engine handle it via the stereo mix or use a different solution for 3d audio, unfortunately Sony blocks other formats in games like Atmos and j believe DTS:X as well but thankfully there are other ways to handle it so just set a game to headphones and you're likely in better hands... Yes this defeats the entire purpose of 3d audio and headphones that claim to produce it but it is what it is.  The good news is the pulse3d Sony headphones could do Atmos fairly well on PC but when I tested these on PC with Atmos there was an issue but it should be fixed by now.  Unfortunately using Atmos isn't free and you need to buy a license for $20 but that license will be yours forever.  If only Sony would support the format too even if it meant you paying the fee instead of them.Now with positional audio out of the way let's move onto Noise Cancelling...[Section 4- Active Noise Cancelling, these aren't xm3, 4 or 5's]This is done by using exterior microphones on the headphones to record what's going on around you and then use the opposite sound waves from the headphones speaker to cancel most of that sound out.So far the best Sony has done at an affordable level is the xm4's which slightly beat the xm5's due to their ability to block things of all frequency at a nearly equal level where the xm5's are great at voices but not so great at things like air-conditioners or wind and mid range intermittent but repeating sounds  The xm5's are also slightly better than the xm4's at blocking low frequencies but the 4's win when it comes to mids & highs.For some basic comparison... the Sony xm5's block 29 db overall, while xm4's block 30db but the frequencies they block are more common in an interior setting which make these headphones severely lacking in ANC (or Active Noise Cancelling) and they are actually based on the $150ish (probably less these days) Sony xb910n's which I confirmed by comparing their noise cancelling, sound ranges and features along with internal design and external mics. They both block 19db of sound EXACTLY and both focus on low and mid frequencies with kinda ok high frequency blocking but you would be best served if they focused on blocking low & high as they are easiest to hearThe fact that they are based on a pair of $150 (probably less now) Sony ANC headphones that also can do 3d audio via various formats and will connect to almost any device wirelessly or wired makes their price absolutely unacceptable.  This however being Sony means they won't work on PlayStation unless you use them wired via controller but that means no 3d audio.  Very consumer friendly of them... I understand wanting to sell the higher priced item but they shouldn't block lower priced one's when they are fully capable of the same thing.  Male your high end kit actually worth the asking price, don't force people to only have 2 options.[Section 5- Conclusion]Go with the pulse3d if noise cancelling isnt absolutely necessary, they are significantly cheaper and when at half volume they block out most sound anyways (9db without audio which is only 10db less than these).  It's either that or buy a different brand altogether but I wouldn't recommend these unless they were $175, 200 at most but considering everything $150 is where they belong and only because they added ANC even if just barely more than normal headphones also block by covering your ears.  They are an older design with a new shell and a low end voice chat boom mic.. very low end.  Friends could hear my Dyson bladeless fan on setting 3\/10 and it was 9 feet away & not pointing anywhere near my direction.  It's too sensitive and needs to be higher quality for the asking price.  Really that's the issue here... What you get for the price.At this price they are a truly bad value and feel like a bait & switch thanks to the WH1000XM series they resemble despite being in the xb900 series.  I've seen so many people comparing them to that series from Sony.  I understand why... They look sort of look like them, they are in that price range and made by the same company. I was fooled into buying them but then I started using them and could hear things I couldn't with my xm3-5's.  Then I got out a pair of xb910n's I had been holding onto as emergency backups and they matched in every way.... I couldn't believe it."],"Store":"a"},{"Srno":29,"Product_Name":"EKSA E900 Wired Stereo Gaming Headset-Over Ear Headphones with Noise Canceling Mic Detachable Headset Compatible with PS4 PS5 PC Laptop (Red)","Description":"NA","Price":1599.0,"Url":"https:\/\/www.amazon.in\/sspa\/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo2NDI2MTA2MTQyMDc2ODQ3OjE2NjQ1MjM2MDU6c3BfbXRmOjIwMDQyMTUwMjg2NzA2OjowOjo&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGY&url=%2FEKSA-Headset-Over-Headphones-Detachable-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB089K72JNW%2Fref%3Dsr_1_12_sspa%3Fkeywords%3DGaming%2BHeadphone%26qid%3D1664523605%26qu%3DeyJxc2MiOiI1LjkzIiwicXNhIjoiNS43OCIsInFzcCI6IjQuOTgifQ%253D%253D%26sr%3D8-12-spons%26psc%3D1","Image_URL":"https:\/\/images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41NaQY68uOL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg","Ratings":4.0,"Reviews":["AndroidGuysHOME  REVIEWS  ACCESSORY REVIEWSAccessory ReviewsEKSA E900 Pro Gaming Headset reviewBy AndroidGuys -July 29, 2020Headphones come in a wide variety of designs and usage cases. Suffice it to say, there\u2019s not really a \u201cone size fits all\u201d for very many of us. The headphones we use at the gym might not be the same ones we\u2019d turn to for long-term playlists or online gaming.Then there\u2019s the topic of budget. Not everyone can afford a pair of premium cans for queuing up The Dark Side of the Moon.Finding the right model, and doing so within a reasonable budget, can be tough. Fortunately, there are brands like EKSA who create products that are not only flexible but which also stay on cheaper side of things. Take, for instance, its new E900 Pro.What is the EKSA E900 Pro?The EKSA E900 Pro Gaming Headset is a well-crafted tool that every gamer needs in his or her inventory. This listening device performs extremely well, and unlike most gaming headsets you see, comes with completely detachable and customizable setup options to ensure that it can be applied to any audible experience.The E900 Pro are versatile; it can go from being traditional headphones plugged into a phone one moment to a gaming-ready headset with a noise-canceling microphone for a PC the next.What\u2019s included in the box?The headset bundle comes with the headphones, a detachable microphone, a lockable auxiliary cord, a USB-C to USB 3 adapter, and an auxiliary to audio and microphone splitter adapter. All of which can all be carried in its leather drawstring bag.Included with this headset and its physical accessories is a code for redeemable surround sound driver software that will enhance your gaming or casual listening experience, an extendable warranty (up to 24 months), and a redeemable gift option of another EKSA item (storage pouch), and a 40% coupon to be applied to your next purchase.Let\u2019s talk setupThe setup is simple: all you have to do is unpack the headphones and cords, plug them into the appropriate ports, and start playing.It took me a couple of minutes to do that, but once you\u2019ve associated yourself with each accessory, it\u2019ll be super easy to take out and set up.The additional 7.1 Surround Sound software (which sadly only works with Windows users) can be downloaded on the Eksa website. The type of surround sound (Old vs Pro) depends on your unit\u2019s serial number and seems to be randomly assigned.How about the design?The design of these headphones is pretty awesome if I do say so myself. The E900 Pro are extremely clean, polished-looking, compact, and easy to carry around. The red emblem on the outsides lights up if your USB cable is plugged in, giving it a bit of added flair. The memory form headband and ear cushions make these extremely comfortable to wear.And the sound?The sound quality of these headphones is surprisingly nice. From playing a game like Torchlight II or Fortnite to talking with friends on Discord and watching YouTube, the quality of the sound is great.It\u2019s nice to be able to switch from 3.5mm headphone cable to USB and we really appreciate what happens when using the 7.1 Virtual Surround Sound. It would be nice, however, if that feature translated to the Xbox One or PS4.What about performance?The main reservations I have with the design are more or less what I\u2019d term inconveniences or questionable choices.Take the mute button as an example. It is located near the back of the left headphone and is always confusing to me. It reads as a microphone with a slash through it, which I would assume as being mute. But when it is pushed in, it is, in fact, not mute.And another thing, the volume scroller (near the mute button) scrolls down to amplify volume and up to minimize volume. I suppose this could be pretty easily understood after a moment or two, or with regular usage, but in the heat of a game it seems counter-intuitive.Would you recommend the EKSA E900 Pro?Overall, this is a nice headset with a price that\u2019s in line with expectation. Of course, they\u2019re not perfect, but they are right for a middle-of-the-ground gamer such as myself.The sound quality is nice, the design is cool, compact, and extremely comfortable, and they\u2019re compatible with most mainstream gaming consoles.If you\u2019re just dipping your toes into the gaming water, or want to step up from the headphones that came with your console, these are a good starting point.These headphones can be bought online at Eksa\u2019s official website for about $35 as well as through AliExpress and Amazon.Note: Select outbound links may include affiliate tracking codes.

But as it is wired, you may face some distortion\/static noises if the cable gets little loose with time.","This headphone is absolutely fire!!! If you wanna buy headphones under 2k, go for this headphone. This is the best budget headphones as far as I know. The sound quality, built quality is really fine. The mic quality is also very good, crystal clear. The bass is also good, its worth the price you pay. They provide all wires necessary. Highly recommend this headphone.","Have been using the headphones since october 2021 no complaints till now mic is good and the headphones produces great sound for gaming as well as entertainment after a few tweaks in the equilizerbut now the left ear piece seems to not work good thing it has 1 year warranty gonna replace it","I just bought it for 999 ruppes which is really the best price im feeling so lucky that i bought it for just 999 ruppesThe sound quality is really greatDecent bassQuality of the mic is also nice and noise cancelation recording work properlyOveral best and wort it!If you are thinking to buy a gaming headphone \ud83c\udfa7 in the budget of 1600 ruppes i will strongly suggest you to buy itThe headphone really justify its price","Pros1.Build quality is really good , and looks premium.2. Lightweight.3. Mic (detachable) quality is really awesome and gets lock when inserted.4. I play apex legends , csgo and found stereo separation really good and informative.5. Nice cushioning6. Overall sound is quite soothing to ears , and bass is also soothing & good for me .Cons1. Clamping force is quite more at first but gets normal with the use .2. Wire quality is good , but inline controller is a bit old design .there are no such cons to cause a dealbreaking situation.","","its been 1 year and the sound quality and condition of these headphone is as it was when i bought itand audio quality is still great. There is just 1 flaw the splitter is not as durable as headphones","I ordered these headphones May 2021 and they were perfect! I play online on my xbox one s fairly often (at least three times a week) and these headphones were great. My ears are sensitive to tight headphones, but I would only have to take 1 break for a several hour session, (I was taking 5-6 before).However, the other day (August 2022), I accidentally pulled out the detachable microphone while organizing my cords. I'd never done it before, as I only use the headphones for gaming. Now, no matter what I do, my audio won't go through. I can hear the gameplay just fine, but it's almost as if the microphone is broken.Not sure if I just got a fluke pair where this was the case, or if it's because they're a little over a year old, but I was super disappointed. I'll probably be trying out a new pair of headphones without the detachable mic, just so I won't have to worry about this again. They were great while they lasted, but I'd like a little more wear for my money.","The first time I ordered this it actually worked great for a few months! But then the mic stopped working and it was out of my return window so I ordered a new one. This one the mic lasted for about a day before people on the other end couldn't hear me anymore. So I was able to exchange with a new one since it was within my return window but again the mic only lasted about a day before the same thing happened. Do not waste your time or money on this!","One set came in, no splitter, mic didn't work.  Second set came in, no mic, no splitter.  Both times I believe I was sent repackaged headsets.  Stay away.  Spend your money on a more reliable option.","the title says it all if you use the included splitter it makes the headphones sound like your listening to dollar store headphones through a tin can. removing the splitter makes them sound significantly better but also makes them worthless as a headset since the mic can't get any signal unless you have a case or laptop with a headphone\/mic combination headphone jack. avoid and get something else, I know I will after returning these.","these have very very rich and good sound quality. i personally do not use the included detachable mic. the red\/purple\/blue\/green part is actually metal so they feel really solid and good in hand. they do feature a open back design thats why there are holes in the back. the leather is very very soft and you wont have to worry if you wear glasses, i do not get any pain while wearing glasses. the cable is about 5 feet long and is a normal headphone cable. there is a splitter cable if you do plan to use the included mic. the headband also has very plush and soft foam aswell"],"Store":"a"}]
